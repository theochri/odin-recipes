        fall or holiday dessert!</p>
    <p>Let's dig into it!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>For the dough
        <li>250g butter,cold,cut into cubes</li>
        <li>450g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>50g icing sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs,medium</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>For the filling
        <li>3 red apples</li>
        <li>3 Granny Smith apples</li>
        <li>lemon juice, from 1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>50g digestive cookies,crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>To assemble</ul>
    <li>50g butter, for the tart pan</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk, from a medium egg, diluted with 1 tablespoon of water</li>
    <li>50g granulated sugar, for sprinkling</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>For the dough
        <li>Add the butter, flour, icing sugar, and salt into a large bowl, and knead them with your hands for 1 minute,
            until the butter is completely dissolved and the mixture looks like wet sand. Ideally, you should wear
            gloves to prevent the heat of your hands from melting the butter.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and the water, and mix well until you have a smooth, pliable dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the dough, for 1-2 hours, until it is cool and set.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>For the apples
        <li>Place a large frying pan over high heat and allow it to heat up well.</li>
        <li>Peel the apples and cut them into medium-sized slices.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar to the pan and allow it to caramelize.</li>
        <li>Once it is caramelized, add the apples and stir well with a serving spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice and stir with the spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the cinnamon, lower the heat to medium, and simmer the apples for 5-10 minutes until they are tender.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the caramelized apples to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed cookies and mix well with a spoon.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>To assemble
        <li>Preheat the oven to 170°C (340° F) set to fan.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on your worktop.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into two pieces.</li>
        <li>If the room is warm, place 2 parchment paper pieces on your worktop and roll out the dough between them, so
            that the butter inside the dough does not heat up.</li>
        <li>Use a rolling pin to roll out the first dough piece into a thin, round sheet. If needed, dust it with more
            flour and cover it with a piece of parchment paper to roll it out more easily.</li>
        <li>Butter a 28 cm round springform tart pan and spread the round dough sheet in it.</li>
        <li>Trim the overhanging edges and spread the apple filling over the dough.</li>
        <li>Use the rolling pin to roll out the second dough piece into a thin sheet and cut it into long strips.</li>
        <li>Place the dough strips over the apple filling, in a zig-zag pattern, and trim the overhanging edges.</li>
        <li>Use a pastry brush to spread the egg wash over the apple pie and sprinkle it with the sugar, so it becomes
            nicely golden during baking.</li>
        <li>Transfer the tart pan to the oven and bake the apple pie for 50-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the tart pan from the oven and take the apple pie out of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cut the apple pie into pieces and serve with icing sugar and mint leaves.</li>
    </ol>
